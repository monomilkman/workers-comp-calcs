# Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Benefits Calculator - Claude Development Session

## Project Overview
This application is a comprehensive Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Benefits Calculator built with React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It helps attorneys and workers calculate various benefit types, track payment ledgers, generate demand calculations, and manage settlement distributions with attorney fee calculations.

## Development Session Summary

### Initial Requirements
The user requested modernization of an existing Workers' Compensation calculator with:
- TailwindCSS styling for modern UI/UX
- Dark mode toggle with persistent preferences
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Enhanced navigation with tab system
- Accessibility features and professional styling
- Toast notifications and loading states

### Key Features Implemented

- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with tablet and desktop optimizations
- **Navigation System**: Tab-based interface (Calculator, Payment Ledger, Settlement, Settings)
- **Icon System**: Lucide React icons throughout the application
- **Typography**: Proper hierarchy and readable font sizing

#### 2. Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Logic

- **Critical Business Rule**: Combined Section 35 + 35EC limit (208 weeks shared)
- **Rate Calculations**: Proper weekly benefit calculations based on AWW
- **Statutory Limits**: Enforcement of Massachusetts benefit maximums
- **Payment Tracking**: Comprehensive ledger system with running totals

#### 3. Settlement Calculator & Attorney Fees
- **Fee Structures**: 
  - Accepted Liability: 20% attorney fee
  - Unaccepted Liability: 15% attorney fee
- **Fee Override**: Custom attorney fee arrangements
- **Expense Tracking**: Attorney expense reimbursements
- **Deductions System**: 
  - Child Support
  - Tax Liens
  - Medical Liens
  - Other Custom Deductions
- **Settlement Statements**: Professional PDF generation with detailed breakdowns

#### 4. Export & Data Management
- **PDF Generation**: Demand calculations and settlement statements using jsPDF
- **CSV Export**: Ledger data for external analysis
- **JSON Sessions**: Save/load complete calculation sessions
- **localStorage Integration**: Persistent data storage

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Technologies
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **TailwindCSS v3** for styling (downgraded from v4 for compatibility)
- **jsPDF** for PDF generation
- **Lucide React** for modern icons

#### Key Components
- `SettlementCalculator.tsx`: Comprehensive settlement and fee calculator
- `BenefitCard.tsx`: Individual benefit type displays with usage tracking
- `RemainingSummary.tsx`: Combined benefit limit summaries
- `ExportButtons.tsx`: Data export and session management
- `DemandBuilder.tsx`: Legal demand calculation generator

#### Custom Hooks
- `useCalculations.ts`: Central calculation logic with combined benefit limits
- `useLocalStorage.ts`: Data persistence and session management
- `useTheme.ts`: Dark mode context and theme management

### Critical Fixes Applied

#### 1. TailwindCSS Compatibility (v4 → v3)
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install tailwindcss@^3.4.0
```
Fixed build errors and ensured stable styling framework.

#### 2. CSS Border Error
```css
/* Removed invalid universal selector */
* {
  border-border: 1px solid hsl(var(--border)); /* ❌ Invalid */
}
```
Fixed critical CSS compilation error.

#### 3. Text Overflow in Benefit Cards
```typescript
// Changed from cramped 3-column grid to flexible layout
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-1">
  <div className="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
    {formatCurrency(yearlyAmount)}
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 4. Combined Benefit Limits
```typescript
const combined35Weeks = weeksUsedByType['35'] + weeksUsedByType['35ec'];
const section35MaxWeeks = 208; // 4 years shared between 35 and 35EC
const combined35Remaining = Math.max(0, section35MaxWeeks - combined35Weeks);
```
Implemented Massachusetts-specific business rule.

#### 5. JSX Syntax Errors
Complete rewrite of SettlementCalculator component to fix:
- Unterminated JSX contents
- Proper component structure
- State management improvements
- TypeScript interface compliance

### Massachusetts Legal Compliance

#### Settlement Logic
- **Benefit Waiver**: Settlements waive all future weekly benefit rights
- **Attorney Fees**: Proper percentage calculations based on liability acceptance
- **Deduction Management**: Comprehensive tracking of all settlement deductions
- **Statement Generation**: Professional PDF statements for legal documentation

#### Calculation Accuracy
- **AWW Calculations**: Proper average weekly wage handling
- **Benefit Rates**: Current Massachusetts rates with date-based calculations
- **Statutory Maximums**: Enforcement of state-mandated benefit limits
- **Combined Limits**: Accurate tracking of shared benefit periods
